Jace, a 29-year-old autistic streamer, has been broadcasting for eight hours straight, playing a newly released game. The stream started well, with high energy and lots of viewer engagement. However, as time passes, Jace begins to feel overwhelmed due to fatigue and the pressure to stay social for so long.

Recognizing the early signs of an impending meltdown, Jace decides to take a short break. They quickly explain to their viewers that they need a few minutes, promising to return shortly. Jace steps away from the camera, turns off the mic, and takes some time to calmd calm down in a quiet space.

After about 15 minutes, feeling more regulated, Jace returns to the stream. They turn on the camera and mic, and greet their audience. However, as they glance at their viewer count, their heart sinks. The number has dropped significantly, with only a few people left.

Jace tries to shake off the disappointment, but can't help feeling a mix of guilt and frustration. They wonder if they should have pushed through instead of taking the break, or if there was a better way to handle the situation without losing so much of their audience.
