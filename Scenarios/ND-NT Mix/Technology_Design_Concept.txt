ND Only Mode: ND Only Mode is just like follower only or subscriber only mode. Want to have a discussion about topics that only a neurodivergent person should be commenting on? Sometimes neurotypical people have things to say about your ND experiences, but right now you don't need their perspective. Let ND voices take center stage. Turn on ND Only Mode and only members of your audience that are neurodivergent will be able to chat. How does ND Only Mode know if someone in the audience is ND? Maybe you decide, maybe the audience decides?
