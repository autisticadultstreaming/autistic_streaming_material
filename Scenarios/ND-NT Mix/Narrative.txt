Jamie, a 28-year-old autistic streamer, has built a reputation for creating content that resonates with neurodivergent viewers. Their streams involve discussions about special interests, sensory experiences, navigating a neurotypical world, and mental health.

One day, Jamie decides to stream about their experience with masking and burnout. As the stream progresses, Jamie notices something a bit off in the chat. While many neurodivergent viewers are sharing their own experiences and offering support, there's also some neurotypical viewers who, despite good intentions, are misunderstanding key points and inadvertently derailing the conversation.

Jamie feels torn. They want to maintain an open and educational space but also recognize the need for a safe environment where neurodivergent viewers can freely express themselves without constant explanation or potential misunderstanding. They wonder if there's a way to create a more focused discussion space for topics that are particularly sensitive or specific to neurodivergent experiences.
